GPU-Hash-Recoverer
==================

A program in Nvidia CUDA to recover plaintext password of a MD5 hash. It performs intelligent dictionary manipulation on graphic card (for quick password recovery). It brute forces plain text generation when everything else fails.

We have optimized data structures for quicker MD5 calculation.
